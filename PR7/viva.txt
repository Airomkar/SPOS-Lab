# 🧠 **1️⃣ FCFS (First Come First Serve Scheduling)**

### 🔹 **Concept**

* Processes are executed **in the order of their arrival**.
* The CPU is allocated to the process that arrives **first** in the ready queue.
* **Non-preemptive**: Once a process starts, it runs till completion.

### 🔹 **Key Formulae**

```
Completion Time (CT) = start time + burst time  
Turnaround Time (TAT) = CT - AT  
Waiting Time (WT) = TAT - BT
```

### 🔹 **Characteristics**

* **Type:** Non-preemptive
* **Basis:** Arrival Time
* **Fairness:** Simple but causes **Convoy Effect** (long process delays shorter ones)

### 🎓 **Viva Questions**

1. What is FCFS scheduling?
   → CPU is allocated to processes in the order they arrive.

2. Is FCFS preemptive or non-preemptive?
   → Non-preemptive.

3. What is the main disadvantage of FCFS?
   → Convoy effect — short processes wait for long ones.

4. How is waiting time calculated?
   → WT = TAT - BT.

# 🧠 **2️⃣ SJF Non-Preemptive (Shortest Job First)**

### 🔹 **Concept**

* The process with the **shortest burst time** is selected next.
* **Non-preemptive**: Once a process starts, it runs till completion.

### 🔹 **Characteristics**

* **Goal:** Minimize average waiting and turnaround times.
* **Problem:** Starvation — long processes may wait indefinitely.

### 🔹 **Formulae**

```
TAT = CT - AT  
WT = TAT - BT
```

### 🎓 **Viva Questions**

1. What is SJF?
   → Process with the smallest burst time is selected first.

2. Is SJF preemptive or non-preemptive?
   → Non-preemptive.

3. What is the drawback of SJF?
   → Starvation of long processes.

4. What is the advantage of SJF?
   → Minimum average waiting time.

# 🧠 **3️⃣ SJF Preemptive (Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF)**

### 🔹 **Concept**

* A preemptive version of SJF.
* At any time, if a new process arrives with **shorter remaining burst time**, it **preempts** the running one.

### 🔹 **Characteristics**

* **Preemptive**
* **Efficient**, but may cause **starvation**.

### 🎓 **Viva Questions**

1. What is the difference between SJF and SRTF?
   → SRTF allows preemption; SJF does not.

2. Why is SRTF optimal?
   → It gives the minimum average waiting time.

3. What is preemption?
   → Temporarily stopping a process to run another.

4. What causes starvation in SRTF?
   → Long processes keep getting preempted by shorter ones.

# 🧠 **4️⃣ Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**

### 🔹 **Concept**

* Each process has a **priority value**.
* CPU is allocated to the process with **highest priority** (lowest priority number).
* **Non-preemptive**: Once running, it cannot be interrupted.

### 🔹 **Characteristics**

* **Basis:** Priority instead of Arrival or Burst time.
* **Problem:** Starvation (low priority processes may never run).
* **Solution:** Aging (gradually increasing priority over time).

### 🎓 **Viva Questions**

1. What is Priority Scheduling?
   → CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority.

2. Is it preemptive or non-preemptive?
   → Can be both; this one is non-preemptive.

3. What is aging?
   → Gradually increasing priority of waiting processes to prevent starvation.

4. What is the drawback?
   → Low priority processes may starve.

---

# 🧠 **5️⃣ Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)**

### 🔹 **Concept**

* A process with a higher priority **can preempt** a lower-priority process.
* The CPU always executes the process with **highest priority**.

### 🔹 **Characteristics**

* **Preemptive**
* Can lead to **starvation**.
* Often used in **real-time systems**.

### 🎓 **Viva Questions**

1. What is the main difference between preemptive and non-preemptive priority scheduling?
   → Preemptive allows interruption by higher-priority process.

2. What happens when two processes have the same priority?
   → The one that arrived earlier runs first.

3. What is starvation in priority scheduling?
   → Low priority processes may never get CPU time.

---

# 🧠 **6️⃣ Round Robin Scheduling**

### 🔹 **Concept**

* Each process is given a **fixed time quantum** (e.g., 2 ms).
* After its time expires, the CPU is given to the next process in the queue.
* **Preemptive** and **fair** scheduling algorithm.

### 🔹 **Characteristics**

* **Best suited for time-sharing systems.**
* Reduces starvation.
* If time quantum is small → more context switches.
* If large → behaves like FCFS.

### 🎓 **Viva Questions**

1. What is Round Robin Scheduling?
   → Each process gets equal CPU time in cyclic order.

2. What is Time Quantum?
   → The fixed CPU time given to each process.

3. What happens if a process doesn’t finish within its time quantum?
   → It is moved to the end of the queue and resumes later.

4. Is RR preemptive or non-preemptive?
   → Preemptive.

5. What are the advantages of RR?
   → Fair, simple, and suitable for time-sharing systems.

Would you like me to create a **summary chart with Gantt charts (timeline diagrams)** for these algorithms using an example input (e.g., 4 processes with AT/BT)?
It helps visualize how each algorithm schedules processes differently — very useful for viva answers and practical explanation.
